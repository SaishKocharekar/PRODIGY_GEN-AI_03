🎨 Task 03 – Markov Chain Text Generation
Internship Project – Prodigy Infotech

📌 Overview  
This project is part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech under the domain of Generative AI.  
In this task, I explored how to generate text using a simple Markov Chain algorithm. The system learns word transition patterns from a given dataset (`Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.txt`) and produces new, human-like sentences in a book-style format.

🎯 Objectives  
- Understand and implement a basic Markov Chain model for text generation  
- Use a structured `.txt` dataset as training input  
- Generate creative and coherent text in paragraph format  
- Gain practical exposure to probabilistic models and text formatting in Python  

🧠 Model Used  
Markov Chain (n-gram model)  
A probabilistic model that predicts the next word based on the previous one or more words (bi-grams or tri-grams), capturing local word dependencies.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Regular Expressions (`re`)  
- Text Formatting (`textwrap`)  
- File I/O (Google Drive file integration)

🚀 How It Works  
- Mount Google Drive and load `Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.txt`  
- Split text into n-grams to build a Markov transition dictionary  
- Randomly walk through the chain to generate new text  
- Format the output with paragraph-style indentation and line wrapping  

📘 Sample Output  
```
    Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon greedily, his small piggy eyes on his back to
the boys' dormitories. As he passed her the slip and I only work part-time at
Gringotts for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a blocked sink ,
and Ron simply turned back to Hogwarts, sir?" said Terry Boot eagerly.

    "Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous
overconfidence," said Slughorn. "But you said Slughorn airily. Malfoy opened his
eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.

    "Petrificus Totalus!" Harry bellowed again, backing away several more Bludger
injuries during practice because
